A small nice project I picked up after my wife told me she wants to buy a learning tower.
It was the first time I heard about it and saw it costs about 200$. This was enough motivation.
I talked about it with a friend who told me I can download free plans from [here](https://omanuthaetz.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%93%D7%9C-%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%93%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A4%D7%9C/), so I went for it..
