Since I took a wood working course in 2008 I have done some works during the years. Here are a few that are still with me (in spite my wife's objections):

The end-grain cutting board is my first "real" independent wood working project. I was naive and went to a wood warehouse to buy dark and light woods. There, I understood they sell only ~3m long lumber. So I bought one of each and had enough material to make 7 cutting boards and some left overs to prepare a bowl.

A few years after the carpentry course I took a short woodturning course. The course's project was this lamp, and I still had some butcher left overs from the cutting board project so I made this bowl.
