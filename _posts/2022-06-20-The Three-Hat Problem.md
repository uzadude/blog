Quoting from the [source](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~yangwang/Preprints/three-hat.pdf):

> Three players are each given a hat to wear. Written on each
hat is a positive integer. Any player can see the other two numbers but not his own. It
is known that one of the numbers is the sum of the other two. They take turns to either
identify their numbers, or pass if they canâ€™t. 
>
>The following process has taken place:
>Player A: Pass.
Player B: Pass.
Player C: Pass.
Player A: My number is 50.
>
>The question is: What are the other numbers?

In the paper they continue to generalize this question and have a very interesting dicsussion.
