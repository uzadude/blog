In [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) with these rules:
- Only 4 neighbors.
- Create new if two or more neighbors exist.
- Cannot die.

For a 10x10 board, given that it got filled up, prove that there were at least 10 at the beginning. (no need for more than 10 because can start on the diagonal)
