A few years ago we decided that we don't want a large coffee table in our leaving room. It takes up a lot of space, you always find yourself need to walk around it, and without it all the room feels bigger and more free.
However, here and there you do want to have your coffee or soda conveniently when you sit on the sofa. So I decided to turn it into a nice DIY project.

I went to the wood warehouse originally to find some nice butcher block, but they had only 3m long pieces. I needed only about 1m to prepare two coffee table tops of about 43cm in diameter.
So I ended up buying raw wood and had to build it myself. It was a nice practice after not doing it for a few years. This time I remembered to take pictures from the process.

The wood was just 2cm thick but I wanted the table to look thicker, so I've cut the edges and re-glued them so externally the table will look thicker:

Next stage was to cut it to a circle using a router and sand it:

Almost finished, just need to paint it and attach the legs:
