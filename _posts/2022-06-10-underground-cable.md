You are given a 1km x 1km square area and you are told there is a straight line of cable hidden 1 meter below the ground that passes somewhere through this area.

  <figcaption>An example of the hidden cable (red line) and digging lines (blue diagonal lines)</figcaption>
</figure> 

You need to dig in the ground in order to find it â€“ a task which takes a lot of effort.  
How will you dig the minimum length such that you still make sure you will find it.

For example: if you dig ~2.83km you will surely find the red line (the blue diagonals in the picture).
