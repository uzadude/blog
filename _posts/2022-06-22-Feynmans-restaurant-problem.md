Quoting from the [Feynman Lectures](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/info/) (Exercises -> Feynman's restaurant problem):

> Given N (dishes on the menu) and M <= N (meals to be eaten at the restaurant), how many new dishes D should you try before switching to ordering the best of them for all the remaining (Mâ€“D) meals, in order to maximize the average total ratings of the dishes consumed?
