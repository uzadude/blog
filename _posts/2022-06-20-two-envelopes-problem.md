Quoting from the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem):

> Imagine you are given two identical envelopes, each containing money. One contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep the money it contains. Having chosen an envelope at will, but before inspecting it, you are given the chance to switch envelopes. Should you switch?
