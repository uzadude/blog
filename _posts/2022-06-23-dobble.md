*Dobble* is a vary nice speed matching game I played with my kids. The first time I saw it I was amazed by the math here so I decided to "turn" it into a riddle:

There are 55 cards, 8 shapes on each card, and every two cards share *exactly* 1 shape. What is the minimum number of shapes you need to build this game?
